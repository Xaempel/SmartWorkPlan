## Code Style Guidelines
[Return](#reference)

Welcome to the "Code Style Guidelines" section, where we outline the conventions and best practices for the SmartWorkPlan project. Consistent code style is crucial for creating a maintainable and collaborative codebase, and following these guidelines will help us achieve a uniform and readable code.

### 1. Using clang-format

We highly encourage using clang-format for automatically formatting your code. Running clang-format after writing code ensures that the code adheres to the project's code style and improves overall code consistency. It saves time on manual formatting and ensures that all team members use a consistent formatting style.

### 2. VMC Architecture

The SmartWorkPlan project follows the View Model Controller (VMC) architecture to build a clear separation of concerns and promote testability. The VMC architecture helps in building scalable and maintainable code. If you're new to VMC or want to learn more about how it is implemented in our project, please refer to the [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) for better understanding.

### 3. Commit Conventions

We maintain a clear and standardized approach to commit messages to keep the Git history concise and meaningful. For a detailed description of our [commit conventions](docs/git/commit_conventions.md), please refer to the Commit Conventions file. Understanding our commit conventions will help you create descriptive commit messages and contribute to a clean commit history.

These guidelines aim to foster a collaborative environment where everyone's contributions integrate smoothly and maintain the highest code quality. Consistent and well-documented code will lead to a more efficient development process and enable us to build a robust and successful SmartWorkPlan.

If you have any questions or need clarifications on these guidelines, feel free to reach out to us on our communication channels.

Happy coding, and thank you for being part of the SmartWorkPlan project!
