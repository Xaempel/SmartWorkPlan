# Naming Conventions

## Warning: All conventions have not yet been implemented in a project. This situation will change in the future.

### Files Naming Conventions

- **Docs files:** Use PascalCase for file names.

- **CMake files:** Use snake_case for file names.
- **Source code files:** Use PascalCase for files with more than one word. For single word folders, use lowercase letters.

  (e.g.)

  - Source Folder
    - small.hpp
    - OtherBigNameFile.hpp

### Folders Naming Conventions

- **Docs folders:** Use PascalCase for folder names, similar to Docs files.

- **First folders and single-word first folders** Use kebab-case for folders with more than one word. For folders with a single word, use only lowercase letters (e.g., `src`, `include`).
- **Source code folders:** Use PascalCase for folders with more than one word. For single-word folders, use lowercase letters

(e.g.)

- SourceFolder

  - controllers

    - ControllersA.cpp
    - ControllersB.cpp

  - SomeBigNameFolder
    - SomeFile.cpp
